<h1>Homework 1</h1>

<h2>Work progress</h2>

Hi, this project is the first homework for the WAD 2025 course made by <strong>Vladislav Leyman</strong>.
I have written 2 html, 2 css files, and back.py , which is the backend of the page.
When you run the back.py file and enter localhost:5000 in the browser, you will be taken to the main page, where there is a button to go to the profile located at the link localhost:5000/profile. Here you can read basic information about me and my skills. There is also a section with my contacts where my email is listed, you can click on it, but do it at your own risk.)
