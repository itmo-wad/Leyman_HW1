Hi, this project is the first homework for the WAD 2025 course.
I have written 2 html, 2 css files, and back.py , which is the backend of the page.
When you run the back.py file and enter localhost:5000 in the browser, you will be taken to the main page, where there is a button to go to the profile located at the link localhost:5000/profile. Here you can read basic information about me and my skills. There is also a section with my contacts where my email is listed, you can click on it, but do it at your own risk.)
If you want everything to work, then don't change the file paths.
